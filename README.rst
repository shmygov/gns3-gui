The following instructions have been tested with Ubuntu and Mint.
You must be connected to the Internet in order to install the dependencies.

Dependencies:

The following commands will install some of these dependencies:

Finally these commands will install the GUI as well as the rest of the dependencies:

Please use our DMG package or you can manually install using the following steps (experimental):

`First install homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_.

Then install the GNS3 dependencies.

.. code:: bash

   brew install qt
   brew install sip --without-python --with-python3
   brew install pyqt --without-python --with-python3

Finally, install both the GUI & server from the source.

   python3 setup.py install

.. code:: bash

   cd gns3-server-master
   python3 setup.py install
